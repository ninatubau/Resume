    The aim of this project is to develop a general method using deep learning to denoise microscopy image coming from different equipments and biological processes. The method used is based on the Content-Aware Image Reconstruction (CARE) publication.

    The aim of this project is to detect human positions on 2D camera using OpenPose. Classify people 	  on images according to their degree of attention (focus or distract) though a neural network. The     aim is to create a pipeline from jpeg images to be able to labelise images or video stream depending on people's attention for security purposes.

    Shape Variation Analyzer (SVA) is a project that I did during my stay at University of Michigan. It was in collaboration with University of North Carolina and Kitware Inc.

    SVA is a deep learning neural network that allows disease staging of bony changes in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthritis (OA). The disease stage classification is done based on 3D shapes of the bone after processing CT scans. We combines geometrical features and shape descriptor, heat kernel signature, to describe every shape.

    In the political context of the firing of a large number of Turkish researchers since the tentative of Coup d'Etat in 2016 against state institutions, the objective of this project is to try to understand the reasons behind this. We aim to see if we can predict whether or not a researcher is fired by looking at their publications. Therefore, the steps we have followed in this project are the following: 1) Build the dataset by scrapping WebOfScience, 2) preprocess the data, 3) represent words in a vector space using different techniques and 4) use machine learning methods to classify each author as either fired or retained (not fired). 

    *Because of the sensitivity of the data, contact me for further information.*

    From the raw dataset Open Food Facts, we cleaned and processed it in a way to extract as much information. We complemented our data set by scrapping the web.
